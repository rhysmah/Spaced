* I struggled to find a situation in which to implement list comprehensions, itertools, and filter / map.
Knowing what I do now, I'd first plan out my game, including where it would make
sense to implement each of the requirements. I approached this assignment without a specific plan,
so the game took a lot longer to complete than it should have. This was a great learning experience.
